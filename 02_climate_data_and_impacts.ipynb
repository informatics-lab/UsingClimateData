    "## Incorporating Climate Change into business planning\n",
    "\n",
    "When planning for the future of the business, factors are considered that will impact in some way on the future income, expenses, investments or liabilities of the business in question. While weather patterns vary day to day as we have discussed, the overall distribution wass thought to be constant, or at least constant over the time frames considered by business as changes in climate happened sufficiently slowely that it was beyond the scope of business planning outside of niche industries like for example nuclear waste disposal where especially long time frames are considered."

    "As we have seen in the climate data in section 1, the anthropogenic climate change brought caused by human emissions of greenhouse gaseds is happening faster than other forms of climate change would be expected to happen in. With investments in buildings often being in place for 20-50 years, we can see that planning for such investments needs to consider not just the climate of today, but the climate of 2040, 2060 and 2080 as some variables will be sufficiently different to merit making different investment decisions."

    "## Some practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will take a look at some practical examples of considering the impact of climate change on some specific cases.  How do we discover what the impacts of climate change will be on a business? To to that we need some sort of model connecting climate data and business impacts. This could be quite simple, simply stating that some business mteric is proportional to a climate measurement. For example, Ice-cream sales at the beach might be proportional to average daily maximum temperature. In other cases their might be several different variables involved, and a more sophisticated statistical or machine learning model might be required to describe the connections. In general, the pipeline from climate data \n",

    "  * temperature dependant leise and hospitality business \n",
